    <h1>WEBDEV</h1>
    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>In HTML you want t o create a file called "index.html" this will be your primary file and your homepage. You will probably want to create 2 more files under the name of "index.css" and "index.js" this is not needed but will help you keep organisation after you have done that you want to add your code. In the "index.html" file you want to add some code if you are using visual studio code all you need to do is ! then click tab. Once done find the body tag (you know what a tag is because its encased in <> and when its closed it has a / before it) click enter on the inside of it and create a new tag called h1 this will be your header tag. once done you should have to <> with h1 inside. Add some text to this in the middle of the 2 > Here <</p>
    <h2>Adding Your CSS</h2>
    <p>To Add CSS you need to create a line in your "head" tag in this line put <"link rel="stylesheet" href="index.css"> this will connect your css file to your html. Now in your css file add on ne line "h1 {background-color: red}" this will make the backround of your text red.</p>
    <h1></h1>

    <h1>HTML 5</h1>
    <p>This is everything you can do in a .html file!</p>

    <h2>Headers</h2>
    <p>Headers are used to show whats what. Header tags have 6 different types these are h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 and p. these all have different sizes for example</p>
    <h1>This is h1</h1>
    <h2>This is h2</h2>
    <h3>This is h3</h3>
    <h4>This is h4</h4>
    <h5>This is h5</h5>
    <h6>This is h6</h6>
    <p>And this is a p</p>
    <p>these are used for different text things and can be used in css for more organisation</p>

    <h2>Classes</h2>
    <p>Using classes you can help make your css connect to the .html file</p>
    <p>To add a class you need to put class = "name" inside the tag.</p>
    <p>Replace "name" with whatever you want it should end up looking something like this</p>
    <p><"h1 class = "name">Hello World<"/h1></p>

    <h2>Containers</h2>
    <p>Containers help with organisation to. They allow multiple elemants in one container to be edited.</p>
    <div class = "cont">
        <h4>Im in a container</h4>
        <p>im also in a container</p>
        <p>im also in a container</p>
        <p>im also in a container</p>
    </div>

    <p>Containers can be edited in css to look different. Like in that container i changed the background colour.</p>
    <p>You can get creative using css and do all sorts of things with containers.</p>
    <p>You can make a container using the div tag should look like:</p>
    <p><"div><"p>im in a div<"/p><"/div></p>

    <h2>Pages</h2>
    <p>Pages can be very helpful in a website as they mean that not everything is clumped together.</p>
    <p>In my website i use pages alot like NOW. This is a page i have called "webdev" as that is what it is.</p>
    <p>To create a page just go to your site folder and make a new file called whatever you want but it has to end in .html</p>
    <p>To access a page you will need to create a new url. That is done for you but its accessing it that we need to do.</p>
    <p>You can add a elemant to do this tho and it will look like:</p>
    <p><"a href="name.html">Back<"/a></p>

    <h1>CSS</h1>
    <h2>Selection</h2>
    <p>To select a class in css you need to write .classname{ } inside the { } is where you put the css.</p>
    <img src="styles/images/csscont.png" alt="example"> <p>It should look like that.</p>
    <p>To select a elemant just write the elemants tag followed by a { }</p>
    <img src="styles/images/cssh1.png" alt="example">
