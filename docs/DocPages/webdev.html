    <h1>HTML</h1>
    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>In HTML you want t o create a file called "index.html" this will be your primary file and your homepage. You will probably want to create 2 more files under the name of "index.css" and "index.js" this is not needed but will help you keep organisation after you have done that you want to add your code. In the "index.html" file you want to add some code if you are using visual studio code all you need to do is ! then click tab. Once done find the body tag (you know what a tag is because its encased in <> and when its closed it has a / before it) click enter on the inside of it and create a new tag called h1 this will be your header tag. once done you should have to <> with h1 inside. Add some text to this in the middle of the 2 > Here <</p>
    <h2>Adding Your CSS</h2>
    <p>To Add CSS you need to create a line in your "head" tag in this line put <"link rel="stylesheet" href="index.css"> this will connect your css file to your html. Now in your css file add on ne line "h1 {background-color: red}" this will make the backround of your text red</p>
